Overview

This project analyzes the performance of Premier League teams during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons using data mining techniques. The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and contains key performance metrics, including goals, passes, clean sheets, tackles, and disciplinary records.

Dataset

Source: Premier League Dataset - Kaggle

Records: 240 cases

Attributes: 42 variables including performance, disciplinary, and defensive metrics

Objective

The goal of this project is to uncover trends and patterns that can support strategic decision-making in football management by using data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning techniques.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset was structured and well-organized, making it suitable for analysis.

Hypothetical cleaning steps included handling missing values, identifying outliers, and ensuring data consistency.

Data Visualization:

Conducted exploratory data analysis using Tableau to visualize key performance indicators.

Examined correlations between key factors such as possession, goals, and defensive strength.

Machine Learning Model:

Implemented the J48 Decision Tree algorithm for classification.

Conducted multiple iterations to optimize accuracy.

Achieved an optimal model with 47.5% accuracy after refining feature selection.

Key Findings

Teams with higher possession and successful passes had better defensive records (clean sheets).

A strong correlation was found between total goals and shots on target, highlighting the importance of attacking efficiency.

Teams with fewer red cards conceded fewer penalties and goals, demonstrating the value of discipline in defense.

The best-performing model identified key predictors such as total saves, tackles, and clearances as significant factors in team success.

Results and Achievements

The J48 Decision Tree model provided actionable insights into team performance.

The findings highlight strategies teams can use to optimize performance, such as focusing on possession-based play and disciplined defending.

Final Grade: 76/100 (First-Class)

Future Work

Implement additional machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) to compare performance.

Expand the analysis to include player-specific insights for talent scouting and recruitment strategies.

Integrate advanced statistical methods to improve model accuracy and prediction capabilities.
